<!--  Submodels are objects which can be dropped or launched from the user
      aircraft. The trigger is a boolean property, which you define, which when
      "true" causes the submodel to be released/launched.

      A submodel will create an AIBallistic object which will follow a ballistic
      path. By default one submodel will be released when the corresponding 
      trigger is "true".

      The initial conditions (IC) define the object's starting point (relative
      to the user aircraft's "reported position"), and its initial speed and
      direction (relative to the user aircraft).  If you want to release many
      similar objects with similar IC, then you may use the <repeat>, <delay>
      and <count> properties to define this.  The allowed properties are:

      <name>         The name of the submodel.
      <model>        The path to the visual model.
      <trigger>      The property which will act as the trigger. 
      <speed>        Initial speed, in feet/sec, relative to user aircraft.
      <repeat>       Set "true" if you want multiple releases of this submodel.
      <delay>        Time, in seconds, between repeated releases.
      <count>        Number of submodels available for multiple release.
                     -1 defines an unlimited number.
      <slaved>       Not used yet.
      <x-offset>     Submodel's initial fore/aft position relative to user
                     aircraft.   Fore is positive.
      <y-offset>     Submodel's initial left/right position relative to user
                     aircraft.   Right is positive.
      <z-offset>     Submodel's initial up/down position relative to user
                     aircraft.   Up is positive.
      <yaw-offset>   Submodel's initial azimuth, in degrees, relative to user
                     aircraft'snose.   Right is positive.
      <pitch-offset> Submodel's initial elevation, in degrees, relative to user
                     aircraft's pitch.    Up is positive.
      <life>         Life span in seconds.  Default is 900.0.
      <buoyancy>     In ft/sec/sec.  Works opposite acceleration of gravity.
                     For example, if set to 32 the submodel will feel no 
                     gravity. If greater than 32 the object will rise.
                     Default is 0.
      <wind>         Set to true if you want the submodel to react to the wind.
                     Default is "false". 
	  <cd>           The Coeffient of Drag. Varies with submodel shape - 0.295 for a bullet, 
	                 0.045 for an airfoil. Enter an appropriate value. Defaults to 0.295.
	  <eda>          Effective drag area (sq ft). Usually the cross-sectional area of the
	                 submodel normal to the airflow.
      <weight>       The weight of the submodel (lbs). NOT set to 0 on submodel release.You 
	                 may wish to set this value to 0 by means of key bindings or Nasal script.
					 Defaults to 0.25.
	  <contents>     The path to the contents of a submodel. The contents must be in lbs.
	  	 			 Intended for use with drop tanks. The property value will be set 
					 to 0 on release of the submodel: do not also set to 0 elsewhere e.g.
					 in key bindings. Defaults to 0.
