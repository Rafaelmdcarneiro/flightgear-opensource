          <p>Alternatively, FlightGear is packaged for Linux by SuSE, Debian

        <div class="indent">
          <p>The FTP server uses standard anonymous login procedures.  Login
          with the username "anonymous" and use your email address as the
          password.  Most FTP clients and web browsers will do this

        <div class="indent">
          <p>This generally means that the server is at it's capacity.  You
          should receive a message saying such, but your FTP client may be
          hiding it from you.  Your options are to keep trying until a slot
          opens up or try connecting to one of our <i>FTP</i> mirrors listed at

        <div class="indent">
          <p>SimGear is a library of supporting code.  SimGear is only needed
          if you plan on compiling FlightGear -- it is not needed to run
          precompiled binaries.  For more information see

          <p>While the base package only comes with scenery for the San Francisco
          Bay area, you can currently fly just about anywhere in the world.

        <div class="indent">
          <p>While we are working toward building our own 3D models, we have

        <div class="indent">
          <p>We could do that, since the initial download is about 25

          for internet access, buying a CD is a convenient and possibly
          cheaper option.  Although we offer that service (see the website), we
          encourage other groups to redistribute it for their users, especially
          within an operating system distribution which makes installation even

          <p>Well, that depends.  First make sure you are using the appropriate
          versions of FlightGear, SimGear, plib, zlib.  If any of
          the packages are out of sync with the others, compilation may fail.</p>
          <p>The FlightGear <i>Downloads</i> page
          (<a href="http://flightgear.org/Downloads/">http://flightgear.org/Downloads/</a>)
          should tell you what versions you need if you are trying to compile
          the latest stable release.  If you are using a development snapshot,
          make sure all three packages are up-to-date.</p>
          <p>Also ensure that you have some implementation of OpenGL with glut
          support with the appropriate header files.  Linux users with nVidia
          cards should make sure you have the latest drivers from nVidia.  Other
          Linux users make sure you have Mesa3D
          (<a href="http://mesa3d.org/">http://mesa3d.org/</a>)
          and your X server installed correctly.  Windows users see
          <a href="http://www.x-plane.com/SYSREQ/v5ibm.html">http://www.x-plane.com/SYSREQ/v5ibm.html</a>,

        <div class="indent">
          <p>FlightGear (as of June 2001) uses the Portable Libraries (PLIB)
          for playing audio. The audio queue implementation of PLIB is far from
          optimal (in fact it's just wrong).  This seems to work on other
          platforms quite well, but Irix expects things to be programmed
          properly.</p>
          <p>There has been discussion about using OpenAL
          (<a href="http://www.openal.org/">http://www.openal.org/</a>)
          for the next release of both PLIB and FlightGear.  Tests show that
          the OpenAL audio implementation does the job right, meaning that
          these audio problems should be gone by then. In the mean time it is
          best to disable audio on Irix completely (by adding --disable-sound
          either on the command line or to your <code>$HOME/.fgfsrc</code>

          <p>FlightGear supports hardware acceleration, but it seems not to be

          <p>
        <b>Linux users</b>:  If you are an nVidia user, follow their
          directions on getting your card working.  For most other users, make
          sure Mesa is installed property and ensure that you have the
          appropriate kernel device drivers for your card.  Most people (and
          distributions) use modules for their video card device drivers; run
          <i>`lsmod`</i> as root to see what modules are loaded.  You should also
          make sure that you are loading the appropriate modules in your

          who seemed to crash a lot.  The fact that nobody has bothered to model
          crashes may have something to do with it too.  :-)</p>
          <p>The result of this as you have noticed is that with a little
          practice an ingenuity you can trim the ship to fly inverted along the
          ground.</p>
          <p>The quick answer is to hit Ctrl+U (with the default key bindings)
          to warp the plane up 1000ft.</p>
          <p>For the stubborn people out there:  The trick to learn is to roll
          back to normal (non inverted) do this by nursing the elevator to get
          to about 500 feet or so and use the ailerons to snap roll 180*.
          This is all good avionics except for the plane not destroying
          itself.  Remember the controls work in reverse when you are inverted
          and keep that airspeed up!!!</p>

      </a>
    </b>
        <div class="indent">
          <p>First, ensure that you have v0.7.7 or later, the scenery files
          where you plan to place the object, the actual model, and the
          longitude and latitude where you plan to place the object.</p>
          <p>Now get the altitude for your point.  If you don't want to
          calculate this yourself, start FlightGear at your location and take
          note of the altitude.  Here's an example command:</p>
          <p>
        <code>fgfs --lat=45.50 --lon=-75.73 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee fgfs.log</code>
      </p>
          <p>The altitude is probably in feet, so divide the starting altitude
          by 3.28.</p>
          <p>Search the output log file for the first occurrence of the string
          "Loading tile" and take note of the filename.  In the above example,
          the output line looks like:</p>
          <p>
        <code>Loading tile /usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601</code>
      </p>
          <p>Copy a 3D model in a format that Plib understands to the same
          directory as the tile file.  Edit the text file in that directory
          consisting of the tile name with the extension ".stg".  The file will
          already exist if there is an airport on the tile; otherwise, you can
          create it from scratch.  In our example, the filename is:</p>
          <p>
        <code>/usr/local/Scenery/w080n40/w076n45/1712601.stg</code>
      </p>
          <p>At the end of the file, add a new entry for your object,
          consisting of the word "OBJECT_STATIC" followed by the model name,
          the longitude in degrees, the latitude in degrees, the altitude in
          meters, and the heading in degrees.  In our example the line looks
          like:</p>
          <p>
        <code>OBJECT_STATIC Towerax.ac -75.73 45.40 60 0</code>
      </p>
          <p>Save the changes to the .stg file, restart FlightGear, and
          enjoy.</p>

          <p>Contributing to the 2D panel doesn't require any coding at all,
          just a minimal knowledge of XML syntax (i.e. five minutes' worth)
          and good skills with drawing and/or paint programs.  Every instrument
          on the current panel, with the partial exception of the magnetic
          compass, is defined entirely in XML with no custom C++  code.  If
          you want to get started, take a look at John Check's excellent intro
          (<a href="http://rockfish.net/fg/README.xmlpanel">http://rockfish.net/fg/README.xmlpanel</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Likewise, if you want to create a 3D cockpit for FlightGear, or to
          create buildings, external aircraft models, etc., your help is
          *desperately* needed.  The only rule is to go easy on the triangles
          -- a model with 50,000 triangles probably won't be usable in
          FlightGear, and one with 5,000 triangles, only marginally.  If you
          can design a nice 3D cockpit interior for a Cessna 172 (for example)
          in a 3D design program such as ac3D or ppe, we have coders who will
          be happy to add the support code in the C++.</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, you really want to get your hands dirty
          with C++ coding, you'll have to buy a good OpenGL book eventually.
          However, FlightGear uses a high-level library, plib, that hides most 
          of the details of OpenGL.  To get started with 3D C++ coding, you
          can take a look at the plib documentation and learn only as much
          OpenGL as you need, when you need it.</p>
