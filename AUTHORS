Authors of the Flight Gear project.

Flight Gear is a group project and has many contributors.  I have
attempted to make a complete list of people in the ``Thanks'' file
located in the top level directory of this file.

My name is Curt Olson <http://www.flightgear.org/~curt>.  I am the primary organizer
of this project.  I maintain the official source code and run the FG
web site.

My intention is to mention all the contributors to the FG project in
the ``Thanks file''.  Unfortunately, being human, I have likely missed
a few people.  If you have made a contribution, and don't find
yourself listed in the ``Thanks'' file, ***PLEASE*** drop me a quick
reminder.  No contribution is too small to be overlooked!!!
