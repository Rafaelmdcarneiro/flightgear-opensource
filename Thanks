A very special thanks is due to the following people and groups.

Note: as hard as we've tried, it is impossible to perfectly maintain
this file.  If you are aware of someone who you think should be
included here, PLEASE let me know.  Projects like this are made
possible only by the help and hard work of others.  I want to properly
credit everyone who has contributed to this project.


A1 Free Sounds <techie@mail.ev1.net> http://www.a1freesoundeffects.com
  Granted permission for the flightgear project to use some of the
  sound effects from their site.

Syd Adams:
  Added clipping to 2d instruments.  Added volume control to ATC-chatter.
  Created and maintain: DHC2, B1900D, Aerostar 700, S76C+ helicopter,
  Cessna Citation Bravo & CitationX, A6M2 'Zero'.  Assisted with Cessna
  Citation II with Curt and 777-200 with Justin Smithies.


Mark Akermann <flightgear@akermann.org>
  Redone sun code. The sun now consists of three textures with individual 
  colors which are calculated based on the effect of light scattering.
  This is accomplished by using various environmental data and by 
  calculating the distance the light travels through the atmosphere.


Raul Alonzo <amil@las.es>
  Mr. Alonzo is the author of Ssystem and provided his kind permission 
  for using the moon texture. I also used parts of his code as a template
  when adding the texture.  Ssystem Homepage can be found at:

Paul Beardsley <Beardspa@hotmail.com>
  The 1903 Wright Flyer was inspired by a model contributed by Paul
  Beardsley.  Very little of the original model remains, but without
  Paul's excellent work we might not have our own 1903 Flyer. Model
  was reworked and retextured by Jim Wilson.


Jon S. Berndt <jon@jsbsim.org>
  Chief architect of JSBSim, the default flight dynamics model (FDM)
  for FlightGear. Jon's professional work has involved simulation and
  prototyping for vehicles ranging from the F-16 to his current work
  on the space shuttle and future manned launch vehicles. Since 1998
  Jon has been working on creating JSBSim together with co-author Tony
  Peden. JSBSim is an object-oriented, multi-platform aerospace
  vehicle simulator that can be integrated with broader flight
  simulation programs (since it provides no visual model), or run in a
  standalone mode for batch runs. For more information, see the JSBSim
  home page at:  http://www.jsbsim.org


Paul Bleisch <pbleisch@acm.org>

  system.
