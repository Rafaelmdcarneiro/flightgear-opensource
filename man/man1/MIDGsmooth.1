[\fIoptions\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B MIDGsmooth
is a utility that reads GPS data in MIDG format from a text file or from an
MIDG device connected to the serial port, parses it and sends it to a
FlightGear instance for replaying.
.SH OPTIONS

Display usage information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-infile\fR \fIinfile_name\fR
Read GPS data from \fIinfile_name\fR.
.TP

Read GPS data from the serial device named \fIdev_name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-outfile\fR \fIoutfile_name\fR
Save the data retrieved from the device to \fIoutfile_name\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-hertz\fR \fIfrequency\fR
Specify the frequency to use for sending data to the FlightGear instance.
By default, events are sent at a frequency of \fB60\fR Hz.
.TP
\fB\-\-host\fR \fIhostname\fR
